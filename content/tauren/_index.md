The peaceful tauren—known in their own tongue as the shu’halo—have long dwelled in Kalimdor, striving to preserve the balance of nature at the behest of their goddess, the Earth Mother. Once nomadic in nature, the wandering tauren tribes have since united and settled in their ancestral homeland of Mulgore.
