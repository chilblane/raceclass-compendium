In Hearthstone, Darkspear troll hunters exist as two minions: [Stiltstepper](https://hearthstone.wiki.gg/wiki/Stiltstepper) and [Guitar Soloist](https://hearthstone.wiki.gg/wiki/Guitar_Soloist).

With the upcoming inclusion of [void elf demon hunters](/void-elf/demon-hunter/), it may be plausible for new races to become demon hunters, with or without the oversight of the Illidari.
