Drac'thyr death knights do not exist in Warcraft. The race (and associated evoker class) was released after the latest round of death knight race additions.

In lore, drac'thyr emerged from statis long after the creation of all playable death knights, both the Third War ones raised by Arthas and the Fourth War ones raised by Bolvar. It is not likely that Bolvar will have more death knights created again as the threat of the Jailer has passed, but the existence of earthen death knights calls this into question.

It is unknown if drac'thyr physiology is compatible with the undeath magic required for death knights.
