Raised after the Third War (or after the Fourth War by Bolvar if you choose to roleplay it that way), human death knights are combatants that have rejoined the Alliance and the human population after undeath. Like all death knights, there is no specific cultural community they belong to, besides the Ebon Blade and humanity itself.

> Many of the human death knights were holy crusaders or veteran soldiers of human kingdoms that fell in battle in their war to end the profanity of the Scourge. The Lich King raised these fallen champions in undeath as death knights to serve him. Humans are one of the most adaptable races, being proficient in magic and combat. Human society has a foundation in the Holy Light, and having that taken away could be problematic. Nevertheless, humanity has a history of sympathy when it comes to extreme circumstances and as such would be willing to accept death knights into their ranks as they would any other profession. However, one must remember the revilement and hate some highly orthodox followers of the light may have against death knights, as the hatred for Arthas and the Scourge runs deep in human society.
