The demon hunter class is the most exclusive in the game, not just for lore reasons but also technically. For each race that can be a demon hunter, a metamorphosis form and various new character customizations need to exist for both body types. There also needs to be a starting experience for these new races.

Lore-wise, it is during the events before and during the Burning Crusade that playable demon hunters currently emerge: Illidan's night elf followers and blood elves under Kael'thas' command. Any new demon hunter races would require a new story to be implemented, and we can look to the example of Bolvar's Fourth War death knights as how we can get additional races as demon hunters. Perhaps a [new cataclysmic event](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Worldsoul_Saga) requires swelling the Illidari's ranks?

However, there were two additional playable races on Outland at the time that could be added into the existing demon hunter starting experience, if Blizzard only wanted to expand the class to a few more races. This is where _orc demon hunters_ could be introduced. Many orcs remained on Outland, and main of them were the Fel Horde, loyal to the Illidari. Because of their strong ties, it almost feels like a narrative oversight that fel orc demon hunters were not included in the original Legion launch.

In addition to setting up fel orcs as playable for demon hunters, Blizzard could use the opportunity to release new fel orc (mostly red) skins for orcs of any class, as well as other player-requested colors like the Dragonmaw. This would mirror the expansion of customizations that were included for Draenei during Dragonflight.
