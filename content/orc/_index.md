The orcs once lived as shamanic clans on the lush world of Draenor. Corrupted by Kil’jaeden, a demon lord of the Burning Legion, they invaded the world of Azeroth. Eventually able to free themselves from demonic influences, the orcs settled on Kalimdor, erecting their great capital Orgrimmar—from where they fight to find their place in the world they once came to conquer.
