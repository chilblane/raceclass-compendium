Raised after the Fourth War, Lightforged draenei death knights are combatants that have rejoined the Alliance after undeath. Like all death knights, there is no specific cultural community they belong to, besides the Ebon Blade and the possibly the Army of the Light itself. It is not clear how Bolvar's undeath powers interact with the infusion of Light these draenei received before their death.
