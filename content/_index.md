The Race/Class Compendium contains entries for every possible race and class combination in World of Warcraft, whether they are playable or not, and if not, whether their existence is shown in-game, in lore, or in other Warcraft Universe properties.

The idea for this website emerged as previously unavailable races for the monk and warlock classes were added to game, along with [the development team's desire to continue to add new combos as they make narrative sense](https://www.wowhead.com/news/wow-content-creator-interview-with-ion-hazzikostas-on-patch-10-0-7-331876#class-race-combos).

Each entry explains the lore of the combination, including cultural and religious factors, and why it does or does not exist. If it doesn't exist, it provides a plausible explanation for how it can be justified and introduced in-game.

Remember that this serves as a background guide to these combinations, and players always have the agency to roleplay their characters as they see fit.
