Raised after the Third War (or after the Fourth War by Bolvar if you choose to roleplay it that way), blood elf death knights are sin'dorei combatants that have rejoined the Horde and the blood elf population after undeath. Like all death knights, there is no specific cultural community they belong to, besides the Ebon Blade and the sin'dorei community itself.

> With everything the blood elves have suffered through in the past, it was inevitable that the grimmest of the death knights would come from their ranks. Their nature and the grim mark that the Scourge left upon their lands instantly make them a target of spite from their own kin, and the loss of the Light from even the rejuvenated Sunwell has turned many into little more than hollow shells. Turning away from everything they once held dear and fought for in life, many seek only the companionship of their fellow Knights of the Ebon Blade, regardless of what race they herald from.
