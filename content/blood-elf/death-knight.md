Raised after the Third War (or after the Fourth War by Bolvar if you choose to roleplay it that way), blood elf death knights are sin'dorei combatants that have rejoined the Horde and the blood elf population after undeath. Like all death knights, there is no specific cultural community they belong to, besides the Ebon Blade and the sin'dorei community itself.
