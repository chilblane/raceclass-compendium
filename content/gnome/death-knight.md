Raised after the Third War (or after the Fourth War by Bolvar if you choose to roleplay it that way), gnome death knights are combatants that have rejoined the Alliance and the gnomish population after undeath. Like all death knights, there is no specific cultural community they belong to, besides the Ebon Blade and the gnomish community itself.

> Although not considered a race of raw strength or might, becoming a death knight for a gnome may be just another adventure or experiment much like blowing up a Horde encampment. The gaining of unholy strength also augments the strength of gnomes, allowing them to be lethal and still incredibly agile. This added strength, the gnome archetypal insanity and a wanton disregard for safety make the gnome death knight just as deadly as any other race. Do not underestimate them.
