The ancient and reclusive Night elves—also known as kaldorei—have played a pivotal role in shaping Azeroth’s fate. Fighting for the Alliance, many Night elves today still remember events of the War of the Ancients over ten thousand years ago, when they halted the Burning Legion’s first invasion of Azeroth. These ferocious elves will fight tooth and nail to ensure their sacred lands are never again tainted by evil.
