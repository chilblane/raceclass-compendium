Raised after the Third War (or after the Fourth War by Bolvar if you choose to roleplay it that way), draenei death knights are combatants that have rejoined the Alliance and the draenei population after undeath. Like all death knights, there is no specific cultural community they belong to, besides the Ebon Blade and the draenei community itself.

> Draenei are likely the most religious, orthodox and faithful race that currently reside on Azeroth. As such, death knights are considered disgusting, abominable and unholy by most draenei. A death knight of this race may have to look elsewhere for home, as toying with undeath is reviled by draenei. However, draenei make some of the most vicious and deadly death knights. With the loss of the Holy Light, the one thing that draenei all share, they may develop a disregard for geniality or mercy. A caring but strong race with all mercy removed creates a deadly and intimidating presence on any battlefield, and draenei death knights are a force to be reckoned with.
