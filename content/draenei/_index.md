Fleeing the ruined world of Outland—the shattered remains of the planet once known as Draenor—the mysterious draenei crash-landed on Azeroth, where they pledged their loyalty to the Alliance and vowed to destroy their bitter enemy—the demonic Burning Legion. In the wake of the Legion’s defeat, the draenei now seek a new destiny in the blessed Light.
