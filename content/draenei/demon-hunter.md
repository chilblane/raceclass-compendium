Draenei (the playable version, not the Broken) were present on Outland while the Illidari demon hunters were being trained at the Black Temple. While not present during the Legion introductory experience, it could be possible that an individual draenei may have found their way into Illidari training.

In Hearthstone, a [draenei demon hunter](https://hearthstone.wiki.gg/wiki/Soulshard_Lapidary) student exists at the alternate timeline Scholomance Academy. There are also the [Voronei](https://hearthstone.wiki.gg/wiki/Dirdra,_Rebel_Captain), a group of draenei that separated from Velen's leadership to fight the Burning Legion directly, harnessing fel power to do so, much like the Illidari.

With the upcoming inclusion of [void elf demon hunters](/void-elf/demon-hunter/), it may be plausible for new races to become demon hunters, with or without the oversight of the Illidari.
