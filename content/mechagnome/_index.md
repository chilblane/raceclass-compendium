Long ago, a faction of zealous gnomes set out on a quest to improve their bodies and minds. Settling on the isolated isle of Mechagon, they experimented with ancient technology to reverse the Curse of Flesh and become living machines. After facing the perils of full mechanization, they found the ideal balance between flesh and steel. Now reunited with their gnomish cousins, the mechagnomes bring both tenacity and ingenuity to the Alliance.
