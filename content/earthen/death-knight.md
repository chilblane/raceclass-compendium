Little is known about earth death knights as the race is not yet released. Their existence is remarkable as the playable earthen in The War Within are introduced after the threat of the Jailer has passed, so how they are raised and by who (Bolvar?) is not yet known. It is possible these earthen are not the same faction, much like Third War goblin and worgen death knights.

It not yet clear how earthen can be undead.
