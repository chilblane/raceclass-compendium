The goblins’ craftiness and greed make them masters of mercantilism. Reforging old pacts with their one-time allies, the goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel have been welcomed into the Horde. Honing their inherent cunning to a razor’s edge, the goblins hope to use their explosive inventions to rule the world – or at the very least own a profitable percentage of it.
