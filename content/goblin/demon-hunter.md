In Hearthstone, [Rhythmdancer_Risa](https://hearthstone.wiki.gg/wiki/Rhythmdancer_Risa) is a goblin demon hunter.

With the upcoming inclusion of [void elf demon hunters](/void-elf/demon-hunter/), it may be plausible for new races to become demon hunters, with or without the oversight of the Illidari.
