Raised after the Third War, goblin death knights are former members of the Steamwheedle Cartel that have joined the Horde and the Bilgewater goblins after undeath. Like all death knights, there is no specific cultural community they belong to, besides the Ebon Blade and the goblin community itself.

> Hailing from the Steamwheedle Cartel rather than the Bilgewater Cartel, goblin death knights are just as likely to go their own way as they are to join the Horde with the other death knights for safety in numbers. As with gnomes, their short stature makes them an odd choice, but with even less regard for safety and caution than gnomes, backed by unholy strength they are a force of destruction to be reckoned with. Though likely dismayed or even disgusted by what happened to them, many goblins may come to consider the state something of a boon, with their new powers opening new avenues for gathering all kinds of wealth.

It is entirely feasible to roleplay as a Fourth War Bilgewater death knight, or even a Third War one, although the latter is a very unique circumstance.
