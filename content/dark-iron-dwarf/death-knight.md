Raised after the Fourth War, dark iron death knights are combatants that have rejoined the Alliance and the dark iron dwarf population after undeath. Like all death knights, there is no specific cultural community they belong to, besides the Ebon Blade and the dark iron community itself.

> The views of dwarven death knights may be different depending on their clan. Ironforge dwarves regard the undead similarly to humans, as they are also followers of the Holy Light. Wildhammer dwarves have a deep connection to the earth and therefore it would be a struggle for a death knight of this race to live amongst former brethren. Dark Iron dwarves would likely be the most accepting, as their culture revolves around sorcery and using what they have to fight, and death knights may feel more welcome in this society. Much like humans, the Lich King valued dwarves for their stoic nature and high body strength.
